This project showcases a CSS-only accordion built without JavaScript. It uses the checkbox hack (hidden checkboxes and labels) and the :checked pseudo-class to control the open and closed states of content sections.

Key features:

Expand and collapse sections on click

Smooth CSS transitions for animated opening and closing

Supports both multiple open sections or single section behavior

Fully built using only HTML and CSS
