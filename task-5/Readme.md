This project demonstrates how to create a modal (popup window) without using JavaScript. It uses a hidden checkbox and the :checked pseudo-class in CSS to control the modalâ€™s visibility. The modal appears centered with an overlay backdrop and includes smooth transitions for opening and closing.

Key features:

1.Modal triggered by a hidden checkbox

2.Overlay backdrop for focus

3.Smooth CSS transitions

4.Fully responsive design
