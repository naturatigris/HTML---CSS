Objective
The goal of this project is to build a single-page website using clean, semantic HTML and basic CSS styling. The project emphasizes a well-structured layout, simple responsiveness, and a visually clear design.

Features
1.Semantic HTML structure with <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <footer>.

2.Basic CSS for typography, colors, and overall aesthetic.

3.Proper use of margins and paddings to maintain clean spacing.

4.Simple responsive design that adjusts layout for smaller screens using CSS media queries.

How it Works
1.The <header> contains the website logo/title and navigation links.

2.The <nav> provides smooth scrolling or link redirection to different sections.

3.The <main> holds the main content (e.g., about, services, contact sections).

4.The <footer> includes copyright.

Media queries make the site mobile-friendly by adapting font sizes and layout.
