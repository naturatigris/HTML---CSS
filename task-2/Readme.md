Objective
This project is focused on creating a Card Component using HTML and CSS with hover effects to enhance user interaction.
The cards are designed to display an image, a title, and a description neatly, with smooth transitions on hover.

Features
Structured HTML: Cards contain an image, a title, a category, and a description.

Styled with CSS:

Borders and shadows around the cards for depth.

Consistent padding and spacing for a clean look.

Hover Effects:

Background color change and/or slight scale transformation.

Smooth transition for a polished interactive feel.

Responsive Design:

Cards adjust gracefully for different screen sizes using media queries.

How it Works
Each card showcases a different course with an image, a heading, and a small description.

Hovering over a card slightly enlarges it and highlights it with a smooth transition.

Layout is flexible and works on both desktop and mobile views.
