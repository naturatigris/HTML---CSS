This project demonstrates how to create a responsive image carousel without using JavaScript. It combines CSS animations (@keyframes) for automatic sliding and hidden radio buttons with the :checked pseudo-class for manual slide control.

Key features:

Automatic sliding with smooth CSS animations

Manual navigation using radio buttons and labels

Fully responsive and visually appealing design

Built with pure HTML and CSS, no JavaScript
