Key highlights:

Main page structure created using CSS Grid

Flexbox used for flexible alignment and spacing within sections

Overlapping elements achieved with positioning and z-index

Dynamic content reordering based on screen size for better responsiveness

Sticky header or sidebar that stays visible during scrolling

Built fully with HTML and CSS, no JavaScript involved
